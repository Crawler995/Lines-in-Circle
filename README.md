# Lines in Circle

>A casual idea, but looks surprised when finished.<br>
If a quantity of lines cover on a circle, what will we see?<br><br>

All configuration are in `config.js`, you can modify them.<br>
`mapFunc` in it is the interesting item.<br>
When it equals `i * 2`, we will see `Cardioid` curve in the circle.<br>
When it equals `i * 3`, we will see `Nephroid` curve in the circle.<br>
Try to modify it casually, there're endless possibilities.<br>
